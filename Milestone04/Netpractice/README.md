# Netpractice - Network Configuration & Subnetting

Netpractice is a non-coding project at 42 focused on the fundamentals of TCP/IP networking.  
The goal is to solve a series of increasingly complex network configuration puzzles, ensuring that all host computers in a given topology can communicate with each other correctly.

This project demonstrates proficiency in IPv4 addressing, Subnet Masks, and Routing Tables.

## 🛠 Features & Challenges

The project involves configuring various network components to resolve connectivity issues:

### IP Addressing
- Assigning valid IPv4 addresses within specified ranges

### Subnetting
- Calculating appropriate subnet masks (e.g., /24, /30, /26) to segment networks efficiently

### Routing Tables
- Defining next-hop destinations and default gateways for different network interfaces

### Private vs. Public Networks
- Understanding the rules of private IP ranges and how they interact with internet-facing interfaces

## 💡 Key Concepts Learned

### Binary Math for Networking
- Converting between decimal and binary to calculate network addresses, broadcast addresses, and host ranges

### CIDR Notation
- Mastering Classless Inter-Domain Routing to manage network sizes flexibly

### Network Topology
- Understanding the flow of data between Client, Switch, Router, and Internet

### Troubleshooting
- Identifying overlapping IP ranges or incorrect gateways that prevent end-to-end communication
